## What we expect

### Day 1
+ Any Mysql Client 
..* If you dont have one you can install DataGrip 30 day trail [Download] (https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/promo/?gclid=CjwKCAjw1cX0BRBmEiwAy9tKHiE5FZofRZBmHw0Osypd4todpoxBObkLt2S_Y4cWLBvY0m3AcvSGshoCd1IQAvD_BwE)

### Day 2
+ Must have GITHUB account [Singup] (https://github.com/zuto).
+ VisualStudio 2019/2017 [Download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/install/install-visual-studio?view=vs-2019).
+ Atleast .net core 2.2 runtime [Download SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core).

### Mob Programming
I couldn't find a best Live share rich Mob Timing application available online. Setup [Mobster] (http://mobster.cc/) on one of the team member PC
One person controls the keyboard, this is the typist. The rest of the mob discusses the problem, agrees on the solution, and instructs the typist. The typist follows their instructions, puts them into code, and may ask clarifying questions to understand the solution. The rest of the mob guides the typist as needed.

We value the typist as they allow the rest of the mob to focus on solving the problem.

The typist must not code on their own. This balances the participation of all team members and it reduces the dominance of strong characters.

### Take Frequent Breaks As Agreed
Pairing can be exhausting. Taking enough breaks is key to face this challenge. Setup breaks using Mobster App or a simple alarm. 
Don't skip your lunch break: Get away from the monitor and take a real break. Pairing or not, taking breaks is important and increases productivity.

### Camera Always On
Working face-to-face is powerful because we communicate with the whole body, not just our words. And we are much more attentive because any distraction like looking at the smartphone during a discussion will be detected immediately. 

So would advise activate our cameras all the time.

### Whiteboard
We miss to scribble and discuss together on a physical whiteboard. There is no good alternative for distributed teams. What comes next is [Miro] (https://miro.com/) to draw. You can share the Miro board in a video conference, so that everyone puts their focus on the same section of the board.


### Screen Sharing
We tried collaboration IDEs before. Surprisingly, this led to worse collaboration. Impatient members of the rest of the mob circumvented both, the discussion and the typist, by just hacking their ideas, please dont, read Mob programming rules. Try below for .net Users
+ VS Live share is installed by default, if not you can install from the extensions-> Live Share [Try Demo] (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/quickstart/share).This extension allows maximum of five to collaboratively work on code base without needed to push/pull to source control.
+ Zoom - Mostly works, you may need Git or source control hand over, refer GIT push/pull commands.

## 10 Minute Intervals
In a mob session, the typist role rotates periodically. Short rotation periods keep everyone concentrated and every opinion in the mix.

Try rotate every ten minutes.

Surprisingly, taking your turn as a typist allows you a mental relaxation. You just wait for instructions.
