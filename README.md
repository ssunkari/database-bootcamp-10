### Whiteboard
We miss to scribble and discuss together on a physical whiteboard. There is no good alternative for distributed teams. What comes next is [Miro] (https://miro.com/) to draw. You can share the Miro board in a video conference, so that everyone puts their focus on the same section of the board.
